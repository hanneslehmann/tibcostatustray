Tibco Status Tray
====================

A small tray icon / menu which shows the current status of Hawk, RV, EMS and Admin (Windows only)

Created with AutoIt (so running in Windows only). I created this to see immediately which services are up, when I come back to my AWS development machine after a while. Might be enhanced with some more infos (e.g. Ports, etc) in the future.
